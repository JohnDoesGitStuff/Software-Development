# Software-Development
## Cooper Lake, South West Tech, Software Development

This repository has a collection of things I have done over time that I personally think are neat.

I am atleast somewhat competant in a few languages (Java, Python, HolyC) and I have experience fixing many consumer electronics

I'm taking software development because it's something i'd like to know things about and possibly pursue a career in.
